    /**
    * #LuaModule represents Lua source code in form of a reusable Lua module
    * which can be used in Lua scripts of one or more #rlogic::LuaScript instances.
    * Lua modules are expected to follow these guidelines https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lua/lua_modules.htm
    * and have some limitations:
    *     - the name of the module given when creating it is only used to differentiate between #LuaModule
    *       instances on Ramses logic API, not to access them from a script or to resolve a file on a filesystem
    *     - the module is not supposed to be resolved with the 'require' keyword in Lua scripts where used
    *       (due to security concerns) but must be provided explicitly when creating #rlogic::LuaScript instance
    *     - modules are read-only in order to prevent data races when accessed from different scripts with undefined
    *       order of execution
    * #rlogic::LuaModule source code is loaded into its own Lua environment and is accessible in other #rlogic::LuaScript
    * and/or #LuaModule instances in their own environments under the alias name given when creating those.
    *
    * #LuaModule can also be used to help provide property types for #rlogic::LuaScript interface declarations,
    * for example a module with a 'struct' type:
    *   \code{.lua}
    *       local mytypes = {}
    *       function mytypes.mystruct()
    *           return {
    *               name = STRING,
    *               address =
    *               {
    *                   street = STRING,
    *                   number = INT
    *               }
    *           }
    *       end
    *       return mytypes
    *   \endcode
    * And script using above module to define its interface:
    *   \code{.lua}
    *       modules("mytypes")  -- must declare the dependency explicitly
    *       function interface()
    *           IN.input_struct = mytypes.mystruct()
    *           OUT.output_struct = mytypes.mystruct()
    *       end
    *   \endcode
    *
    * The labels (INT, FLOAT, etc.) are reserved keywords and must not be overwritten for other purposes (e.g. name of variable or function).
